# MySynthesizer

MySynthesizer is build based on code by Marc Groenewegen en Ciska Vriezinga. MySynthesizer is a very simple music synthesis application. This project was my first attempt at writing music synthesis code. 

The program should be ran by running MySynthesizer.py. Python 3.6 or later is needed.
The PyAudio module is also required:
```pip install PyAudio```

So far the project includes a: 
- ADSR
- Amplifier
- Averagefilter with LP & HP
- White Noise
- FM
- AM
- Sine, Additive Saw, Pulse
